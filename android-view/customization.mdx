Channel differentiation allows for a more organized and intuitive channel list within your application. By customizing the channel list to accommodate different channel types, users can have a tailored experience that fits the unique needs of different groups or topics.

## **Create channel with custom data**

First, define a new channel type that starts from 1001 and above. This is because Sendbird UIKit reserves channel types from 0 to 1000.

<div component="AdvancedCode" title="Kotlin">


```kotlin,cs-jane.lee-07NOV2023-002

const val NEW\_CHANNEL\_TYPE = 1001

```

</div>




When creating new channel types, custom data may be necessary to differentiate messages. Before sending a channel, you can set its custom type and insert the necessary data for rendering the UI.




<div component="AdvancedCode" title="Kotlin">




```kotlin,cs-jane.lee-07NOV2023-003

SendbirdUIKit.setCustomParamsHandler(object : CustomParamsHandler \{

&#x20;   override fun onBeforeCreateGroupChannel(params: GroupChannelCreateParams) \{

&#x20;       params.customType = NEW\_CHANNEL\_TYPE.toString()

&#x20;   }

})

```

</div>
