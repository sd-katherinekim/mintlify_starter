title: "UIkit for Android View"
description: "With Sendbird UIKit for Android View, you can easily build an in-app chat with all the essential messaging features. The UIKit for Android View supports both Java and Kotlin."
---



The latest version allows you to execute key chat functions, such as list channels, using a fragment, module, and ViewModel. The fragment creates a corresponding module and ViewModel in order to build a whole screen. While the module creates and displays the UI, the ViewModel processes and updates relevant data from Chat SDK in each screen. To learn more about our development kit, visit the pages below.
